# 🌟 Kokoe Fiawoo – Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site was developed as part of my final term project for the Web Development course. It showcases my skills, projects, resume, and contact information in a clean, responsive layout using modern web technologies.

The site includes multiple sections/pages:
- **Home** – Quick intro and welcome message
- **About** – Biography, interests, and background
- **Resume** – Interactive and downloadable resume

- **Contact** – Custom form with validation

## 🔧 Technologies Used
